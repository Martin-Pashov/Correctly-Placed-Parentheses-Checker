# Correctly-Placed-Parentheses-Checker
This is a program that tests to see whether the parentheses are correctly arranged.

It works with a count variable that rises and decreases, depending on whether we have "(" and ")", so "count" will still be 0, but only if the parentheses are correctly placed.
