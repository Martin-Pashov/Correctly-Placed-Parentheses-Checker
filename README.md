# Correctly-Placed-Parentheses-Checker
This is a program that tests to see whether the parentheses are correctly arranged.

It works with a 'count' variable that goes up and down depending on whether we have '(' and ')', which means that the variable's value will remain zero if the parenthesis are appropriately positioned, so therefore, if the value isn't zero, the parentheses were not correctly placed.
