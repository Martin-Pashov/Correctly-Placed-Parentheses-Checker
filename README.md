# Correctly-Placed-Parentheses-Checker
This is a program that tests to see whether the parentheses are correctly arranged.

It works with a 'count' variable that rises and decreases, depending on whether we have '(' and ')', meaning that the value of the variable will ramain 0, only if the parentheses are correctly placed.
